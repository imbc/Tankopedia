Tank'O'pedia
========================

This is just a side project to better understand the use of Symfony2 http://symfony.com/.
The interface is using the default twitter bootstrap for now. http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/

The data is from http://wiki.worldoftanks.eu (online video game around tank warfare)

TODO:

1. refactor the controller for ~~Engine~~, ~~Gun~~, ~~Nationality~~, ~~Tank~~, TankClass, Tier, Track and Turret
     - remove delete control (not needed)
     - remove new/update
     - refactor edit
2. use DataGridBundle for each index template https://github.com/Abhoryo/APYDataGridBundle
3. use DataFixtures to allow to load all data regarding the tanks and modules
    - ~~tank~~: ~~usa~~, ~~ussr~~, ~~uk~~, ~~fr~~, ~~de~~, ~~cn~~
    - modules: engine, gun, radio, track, turret
4. continue with equipment
5. investigate need for hull entity (on tanks) with properties armor (front, side, rear)
6. add battle range for tanks

8. refactor edit/new forms
     - use chosen javascript library for multiselect http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
