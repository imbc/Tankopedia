Tank'O'pedia
========================

This is just a side project to better understand the use of Symfony2 http://symfony.com/.
The interface is using the default twitter bootstrap for now. http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/

The data is from http://wiki.worldoftanks.eu (online video game around tank warfare)

installation:

1. create your virtual host
    - new file in ```/etc/apache2/sites-available/``` for the config of the virtual host
    - symlink to this file in ```/etc/apache2/site-enabled```
    - vhosts's url added to /etc/hosts
    - restart apache service
2. check the database setting and adjust accordingly
3. run composer to fetch all dependencies
4. run the following command to create the tables:
```
    php app/console doctrine:schema:update --dump-sql
```
5. run the following command to populate the tables:
```
    php app/console doctrine:fixtures:load --fixtures=src/Imbc/TankopediaBundle/DataFixtures/ORM --append
```

Access the dev environment through http://virtualhost/app_dev.php/tankopedia/tank/

The virtual host could be ```imbc.local``` or ```localost/imbc/``` if you have set this
