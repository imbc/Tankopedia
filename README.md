Tank'O'pedia
========================

This is just a side project to better understand the use of Symfony2.

The data is from http://wiki.worldoftanks.eu (online video game around tank warfare)

TODO:

1. refactor the controller for Gun, Nationality, Radio, TankClass, Tier, Track and Turret
2. use DataGridBundle for each index template
3. use DataFixtures to allow to load all data regarding the tanks and modules
4. continue with equipment
5. display some chart for the different indexes
6. investigate scrapping data directly from wot for player and save that to local db.
